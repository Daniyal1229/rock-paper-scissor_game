I recently created a Rock Paper Scissor game in Python as a way to practice my basic fundamentals of the language. The game is simple but fun, and it was a great way to learn about variables, conditional statements, and functions.
<br>
The game works by randomly generating a move for the computer and then asking the user to choose a move. The moves are rock, paper, and scissors, and each move beats one other move. For example, rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.
<br>
If the user's move beats the computer's move, the user wins. If the computer's move beats the user's move, the computer wins. If both players choose the same move, it's a tie.
<br>
The game is a great way to learn about the following Python concepts:
<br>
Variables
Conditional statements
Functions
Random number generation
Input/output
<br>
I had a lot of fun creating this game, and I learned a lot about Python in the process. If you're interested in learning more about Python, I encourage you to check out the game.

The code for the game is available on my GitHub repository. If you're interested in checking it out, you can find the link in my bio.
